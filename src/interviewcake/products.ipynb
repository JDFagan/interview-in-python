    "\n",
    "Is there a cleaner way to get the products of all the integers after each index?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can just walk through our list backwards! So instead of reversing the values of the list, we'll just reverse the indices we use to iterate!\n",

    "Now we've got products_of_all_ints_after_index, but we’re starting to build a lot of new lists. And we still need our final list of the total products. **How can we save space?**\n",

    "Well, we want the product of all the integers before an index **and** the product of all the integers after an index. We just need to multiply every integer in products_of_all_ints_before_index with the integer at the same index in products_of_all_ints_after_index!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example. Say our input list is [2, 4, 10]:\n",

    "If the input list is [2, 4, 10], the product of all the numbers before each index is [1, 2, 8]\n",

    "If the input list is [2, 4, 10], the product of all the numbers after each index is [40, 10, 1]\n",

    "If we take these lists and multiply the integers at the same indices, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "The product of all the numbers before an index times the product of all the numbers after an index is the product of the numbers at all other indices: 1\\*40=40, 2\\*10=20, 8\\*1=8.\n",
    "\n",
    "And this gives us what we're looking for—the products of all the integers except the integer at each index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing this, can we eliminate any of the lists to reduce the memory we use?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, instead of building the second list products_of_all_ints_after_index, we could take the product we would have stored and just multiply it by the matching integer in products_of_all_ints_before_index!\n",
    "\n",
    "So in our example above, when we calculated our first (well, \"0th\") \"product after index\" (which is 40), we’d just multiply that by our first \"product before index\" (1) instead of storing it in a new list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How many lists do we need now?**\n",
    "\n",
